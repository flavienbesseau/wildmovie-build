Applicable Law By using any Wild Movie\n            Service, you agree that the laws of the state of Washington, without\n            regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these\n            Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise\n            between you and Wild Movie. Disputes Any dispute or claim relating\n            in any way to your use of any Wild Movie Service, or any products or\n            services sold or distributed by Wild Movie or through the Wild Movie\n            Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in\n            court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if\n            your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal\n            arbitration law apply to this agreement. a. There is no judge or\n            jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is\n            limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the\n            same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and\n            declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms\n            of these Conditions of Use as a court would. b. To begin an\n            arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting\n            arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent\n            Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304,\n            Tumwater, WA 98051. The arbitration will be conducted by the\n            American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including\n            the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\n            The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling\n            1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator\n            fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.\n          </Para>\n          <Para>\n            We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000\n            unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise,\n            Wild Movie will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration\n            unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may\n            choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on\n            written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at\n            another mutually agreed location. c. You and Wild Movie each agree\n            that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an\n            individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative\n            action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in\n            arbitration you and Wild Movie each waive any right to a jury trial.\n            You and Wild Movie also both agree that you or we may bring suit in\n            court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual\n            property rights. Site Policies, Modification, and Severability\n            Please review our other policies. These policies also govern your\n            use of Wild Movie Services.

Does Wild Movie\n            Share Your Personal Information? Information about our users is an\n            important part of our business, and we are not in the business of\n            selling our users personal information to others. We share user\n            information with our parent corporation (Amazon.com, Inc.), the\n            subsidiaries it controls that follow practices at least as\n            protective as those described in this Privacy Notice, and as\n            described below. Transactions involving Third Parties: We make\n            available to you services provided by third parties. For example,\n            you can purchase movie tickets from third parties through Showtimes\n            and Tickets. You can tell when a third party is involved in your\n            transactions, and we share users personal information related to\n            those transactions with that third party. Third-Party Service\n            Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform\n            functions on our behalf.\n          </Para>\n          <Para>\n            Examples include processing payments, removing repetitive\n            information from user lists, analyzing data, providing marketing\n            assistance, and transmitting content. They have access to personal\n            information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it\n            for other purposes. Business Transfers: As we continue to develop\n            our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In\n            such transactions, user information generally is one of the\n            transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made\n            in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user\n            consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Wild\n            Movie.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired,\n            user information will of course be one of the transferred assets.\n            Protection of Wild Movie and Others: We release account and other\n            personal information when we believe release is appropriate to\n            comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and\n            other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Wild\n            Movie, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information\n            with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and\n            credit risk reduction. Other than as set out above, you will receive\n            notice when personal information about you might be shared with\n            third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to\n            share the information. What About Advertising? Third-Party\n            Advertising and Links to Other Websites: Wild Movie Services may\n            include third-party advertising and links to other websites and\n            apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about\n            you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services.\n            For more information about third-party advertising at Wild Movie,\n            including interest-based ads, please read the Amazon Interest-Based\n            Ads policy. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the\n            Amazon Advertising Preferences page. We do not provide your name or\n            other information that directly identifies you to these advertisers\n            or third-party websites. Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: We\n            provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you\n            with more useful and relevant Wild Movie ads and to measure their\n            effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that\n            directly identifies you when we do this.\n          </Para>\n          <Para>\n            Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other\n            device identifier. For example, if you have already downloaded one\n            of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data\n            about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download\n            the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve\n            you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about\n            how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the Amazon\n            Advertising Preferences page. How Secure Is Information About Me? We\n            design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We work\n            to protect the security of your personal information during\n            transmission by using encryption protocols and software. We maintain\n            physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with\n            collection, storage, and disclosure of personal customer\n            information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally\n            request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to\n            you. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access\n            to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications.\n            Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. What\n            Information Can I Access? You can access your information, including\n            your name, address, payment options and profile information in your\n            account settings.

Many of our Wild Movie Services also include\n            settings that provide you with options as to how your information is\n            being used. As described above, you can choose not to provide\n            certain information, but then you might not be able to take\n            advantage of many of the Wild Movie Services. You can add or update\n            certain information on pages such as those referenced in What\n            Information Can I Access?\n          </Para>\n          <Para>\n            When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior\n            version for our records. If you do not want to receive e-mail or\n            other communications from us, please log in to your account and\n            adjust your preferences in your user account settings. If you do not\n            want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your\n            notification settings in the app or device. If you do not want to\n            see interest-based ads, please adjust your Advertising Preferences.\n            The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to\n            prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other\n            identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a\n            new cookie, or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies\n            allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Wild Movie\n            Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. Most devices\n            provide users with the ability to change device permissions (e.g.,\n            disable/access location services). For most devices, these controls\n            are located in the devices setting menu. If you have questions about\n            how to change your device permissions on devices manufactured by\n            third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier\n            or your device manufacturer.
